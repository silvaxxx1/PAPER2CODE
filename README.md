# PAPER2CODE Repository

![Logo](/image.png)

Welcome to the PAPER2CODE repository! This repository is dedicated to the implementation of state-of-the-art research papers in machine learning and deep learning from scratch. Our goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical implementation, providing clear, educational, and reproducible implementations of the models and methods described in these papers. We will be implementing these models using TensorFlow and PyTorch, depending on the specific requirements of each project.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into multiple subprojects, each focusing on a different research paper. Hereâ€™s an overview of the main directories:

- `FC8_VGG/`
- `ResNet50/`
- `VisionTransformer/`
- `Unet/`
- `GAN/`

## Overview

PAPER2CODE is an ever-growing repository that aims to continuously expand with new implementations of influential research papers in the field of machine learning and deep learning. As of now, the repository includes the following subprojects:

- **FCN8_VGG**
- **ResNet50**
- **Vision Transformer**
- **Unet**
- **GAN**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started with the implementations in this repository, you need the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/silvaxxx1/PAPER2CODE.git
   cd PAPER2CODE
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Each subproject contains its own set of instructions and scripts for training and evaluating the models. Refer to the README file within each subproject directory for detailed usage instructions.

## What is the latest implementaion? (GAN subproject)

The GAN subproject implements ideas from the following papers:

1. **Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks**
   - Alec Radford, Luke Metz, Soumith Chintala

2. **On Convergence and Stability of GANs**
   - Naveen Kodali, Jacob Abernethy, James Hays, Zsolt Kira

3. **Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs**
   - Ishaan Gulrajani, Faruk Ahmed, Martin Arjovsky, Vincent Dumoulin, Aaron Courville
