</div>


Welcome to the PAPER2CODE repository! This repository is dedicated to the implementation of state-of-the-art research papers in machine learning and deep learning from scratch. Our goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical implementation, providing clear, educational, and reproducible implementations of the models and methods described in these papers. We implement these models using TensorFlow and PyTorch, depending on the specific requirements of each project.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into multiple subprojects, each focusing on a different research paper. Hereâ€™s an overview of the main directories:

- `FC8_VGG/`
- `ResNet50/`
- `VisionTransformer/`
- `Unet/`
- `GAN/`
- `NLP-Evolution/`

## Overview

PAPER2CODE is an ever-growing repository that aims to continuously expand with new implementations of influential research papers in the field of machine learning and deep learning. As of now, the repository includes the following subprojects:

- **FCN8_VGG**: Implementation of the FCN-8 model based on [Long et al. 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4038).
- **ResNet50**: Implementation of the ResNet-50 architecture following [He et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385).
- **Vision Transformer**: Implementation of the Vision Transformer model as described in [Dosovitskiy et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929).
- **Unet**: Implementation of the U-Net model for biomedical image segmentation based on [Ronneberger et al. 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597).
- **GAN**: Implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks based on [Goodfellow et al. 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661).
- **NLP-Evolution**: A collection of implementations for various natural language processing models including Bigram, MLP, RNN, LSTM, GRU, and Transformer models. Each model is explained and implemented according to key papers:
  - **Bigram**: Predicts the next character based on the previous one.
  - **MLP**: Follows [Bengio et al. 2003](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0308034).
  - **RNN**: Based on [Mikolov et al. 2010](https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.0163).
  - **LSTM**: Implements Long Short-Term Memory networks following [Graves et al. 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1128).
  - **GRU**: Based on [Cho et al. 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078).
  - **Transformer**: Implements the Transformer model as described in [Vaswani et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).

## Project-Specific Information

### NLP-Evolution

The `NLP-Evolution` project explores various natural language processing models implemented in PyTorch. It includes implementations for:

- **Bigram**: A simple model predicting the next character based on the previous one.
- **MLP**: A multi-layer perceptron for sequence modeling.
- **RNN**: Recurrent neural network for capturing temporal dependencies.
- **LSTM**: Long Short-Term Memory networks for improved sequence modeling.
- **GRU**: Gated Recurrent Units as an alternative to LSTM.
- **Transformer**: A powerful model leveraging self-attention mechanisms.

For detailed usage and implementation, see the [NLP-Evolution README](NLP-Evolution/README.md).

### Fun Experiment: Building Layers from Scratch

In the `from_scratch_for_fun.py` file, we implement MLP, LSTM, and GRU layers from scratch using NumPy. This exercise is intended to help gain a deeper intuition about these models and their components. It's not the primary focus of the repository but serves as an educational tool for understanding the underlying mechanisms of these models.
