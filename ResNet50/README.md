# ResNet Image Classification

## Overview

This project implements a Residual Neural Network (ResNet) for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The ResNet architecture is a deep convolutional neural network known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks. The project includes scripts for training the ResNet model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, as well as for making predictions on new images using the trained model.

## Installation

To use this project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. Additionally, install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training

To train the ResNet model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, run the `train.py` script:

```bash
python train.py
```

This script loads the dataset, trains the model, and saves the trained model to a file named `resnet_model.h5`.

### Predictions

To make predictions on new images using the trained model, run the `predict.py` script and provide the path to the input image as a command-line argument:

```bash
python predict.py /path/to/input/image.jpg
```

This script loads the trained model and configuration, preprocesses the input image, makes predictions, and prints the predicted class label.
